Batch replace words from .bf, .bmd, and .pm1 files from Persona 4 Golden and Persona 5

## Usage

2. Select Output Path to be a folder where the input is copied and pasted then edited in place
3. Select which game's files you're editing as well as options to check for case sensitivity or the whole word.
4. Type in words you want to find in the top box and words you want to replace them with in the bottom box
5. Hit replace and wait. (Could take a long time if you're doing an entire dump)
6. Profit

## Editing More than Just Words
If you want to do something more specific than just replacing words (changing newline breaks for example), feel free to clone and modify [EditMsg](https://github.com/TekkaGB/Persona_Intelligent_String_Substituter/blob/ec26cdbbefb09ae036484154cf274aabda094366/PersonaTextReplacer/Replacer.cs#L234) to your liking.
